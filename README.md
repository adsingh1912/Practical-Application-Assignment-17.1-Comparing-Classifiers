Hi all,


The purpose of the analysis is to determine what would be target market for a bank to carry out a marketing campaign to maximize their return on investment. 


Assumptions of the analysis:
        
        
        
        a) No factors were dropped from the analysis to ensure that the analysis can be as comprehensive as possible.          
         
         
         b) The analysis was carried out to not only maximize the accuracy of the analysis but also the precision and recall, which was done by ensuring the maximum               area under the roc curve 


Results and recommendations:
        
        
        
        a) The median age of individuals who subscribed for term deposits was 37 years.
         
         
         b) The highest subscription of term deposits was done by individuals who held the job of an admin, with a median age of 34 years old, followed by those who               held a job as a technician with a median age of 35 years old         
         
         
         c) The highest subscription of term deposits was done married individuals with a median age of 45 years old, followed by single individuals with a median age             of 29 years old
         
         
         d) Home ownership was not a real factor in determining subscription to term deposits.

Next steps:

In terms of data collection, the next steps would be to validate the results of the model with real world data. Also, I would use more techniques such as decision trees and SVM as well as an ensemble to see if we can improve the model further. Additionally, this may result in uncovering more dependencies to improve model characterstics.
